# VIRTUAL-YARDSALE

### DEVELOPMENT STORY
```
The yardsale (or garage-sale, tag-sale, etc.) has long been a staple of many communities, perhaps due to what it offers the neighborhood: a place of coalition and camaraderie, as well as an opportunity to repurpose one's belongings through the structure of a local market. Unfortunately, a global pandemic has rendered most gatherings as unsafe, and in turn, much of the community's social calendar has been put on pause. While we continue to promote the safe and healthy habits of all communities across the world, a Virtual-Yardsale can engage a community safely, from the comfort of one's home, all while maintaining a secure marketplace for buyers and sellers alike. Connecting with our neighbors is the essence of a thriving community, and a thriving community is what we base our own success on.
